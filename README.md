# Hipparcos_with_Python
### Exploring Hipparcos catalog using Python and Pandas 

This notebook demonstrates how Python and Pandas can be used to explore and analyse data presented in the form of a catalog.

The major Hipparcos catalog is a result of a three and half year long Hipparcos satellite mission, and it was released in 1997. Although the main catalog, with over 110 000 stars is small, compared to the final database of 2 million objects, it is still one of the first modern sources of the high-precision measurements of the stellar positions on the sky. It provides stellar space coordinates with high accuracy to the thousandths decimal place.

Notebooks for exploring Hipparcos catalog are:
